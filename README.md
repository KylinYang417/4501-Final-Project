In this project, we mainly divide our project into four parts:
Part1 with Data Processing, Part2 with Storing Data, Part3 with Understanding Data and Part4 for Visualizing Data.

For Part 1, we are downloading Parquet files (both by hand and with Python code), cleaning and filtering for the relevant data, filling in missing data, and generating samples of these datasets.
For Part 2, we are taking the sample datasets generated from Part 1, and populating a SQLite database with tables generated from the datasets.
For Part 3, we are crafting a set of SQL queries to develop a better understanding of the datasets weâ€™re working with.
For Part 4, we are creating visualizations to enhance our understanding of the datasets.
